        apple, (Malus domestica), domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated
        tree fruits. Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though apples are also used commercially for
        vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce, and apple butter and are canned as pie stock.
